For example, your friends or other people you may know have another connection, and it is an undirected graph, which means there is no path between two nodes, while a directed graph has a direction between two or more nodes as long as they are connected. The individual entities are called nodes and the thing that connects those entities are called edges. At first, I was confused as to what the difference between a graph and a tree is since they are similar in terms of connecting nodes, but as I watched the video, I began to understand. A tree has only one path between two nodes, which we can link any two nodes at random as long as we can find the final route, while a graph is made up of a group of nodes and edges. A graph data structure is valuable to learn and master because it can be used to solve a variety of problems in real-life situations.\n"
